# Run Tests

This section covers everything related to executing tests for both the AMI and the OVA. Tests are divided into two essential categories:

- **Unit tests**: These are standard unit tests that verify the internal logic of the code related to the AMI and OVA, ensuring it behaves correctly and without errors.

- **Functionality tests**: These tests validate that the generated artifact (AMI or OVA) works as expected and meets all functional requirements. They ensure the artifact performs correctly in its intended use.

The test procedures are divided as follows:

- **AMI tests** ([ami-run-tests.md](ami/ami-run-tests.md))
- **OVA tests** ([ova-run-tests.md](ova/ova-run-tests.md))
