# Configurating the Wazuh Central Components in the AMI

Any configuration you can apply to the Wazuh components included in the AMI is **identical to configuring them when installed separately**.

This means that if you need to make adjustments or customizations, you can simply refer to the official documentation for each Wazuh component.

> The AMI does not alter the standard behavior or configuration mechanisms of any Wazuh component.
