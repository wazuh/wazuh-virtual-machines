# AMI Installation

There are two alternatives for deploying a Wazuh instance. You can launch the Wazuh All-In-One Deployment AMI directly from the AWS Marketplace or you can configure and deploy an instance using the AWS Management Console.

## Launching the Wazuh AMI from the AWS Marketplace

1. Go to [Wazuh All-In-One Deployment](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-eju4flv5eqmgq?ref=hmpg_recommendations_widget) in the AWS Marketplace, then click **Continue to Subscribe**.
2. Review the information and accept the terms for the software. Click **Continue to Configuration** to confirm subscribing to our Server product.
3. Select a **Software Version** and the **Region** where the instance is going to be deployed. Then, click **Continue to Launch**.
4. Review your configuration, making sure that all settings are correct before launching the software. Adapt the default configuration values to your needs.
    1. **Instance Type**: When selecting the EC2 Instance Type, we recommend that you use an instance type `c5a.xlarge`.
    2. **Network Settings**: When selecting the **Security Group**, it must be one with the appropriate settings for your Wazuh instance to guarantee the correct operation. You can create a new security group by choosing **Create new based on seller** settings. This new group will have the appropriate settings by default.
5. Click **Launch** to start the instance.

Once your instance is successfully launched and a few minutes have elapsed, you can access the Wazuh dashboard.
