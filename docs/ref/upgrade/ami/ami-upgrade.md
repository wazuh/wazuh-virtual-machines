# AMI Upgrade

Upgrading the Wazuh components included in the AMI follows the **same procedure as when upgrading them individually**.

If you need to update any component (Wazuh Server, Wazuh Indexer, or Wazuh Dashboard), you can follow the official upgrade guides provided by Wazuh.

> The AMI does not modify the standard upgrade process of any Wazuh component, so the official documentation remains fully applicable.
